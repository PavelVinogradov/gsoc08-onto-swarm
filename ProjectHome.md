## Goal ##
Main goal of this work - add support for ontology into Swarm framework. Framework must include ability to import ontology from some standard format, use it in model generation and application modeling process. Support for use external ontology, scene visualization and ontology standard improve usability of swarm framework. Simplify model generation, porting and visualization for developers and users.

## Features to be implemented ##
This Summer of Code project scope not include implementation of ontology editor or format - for this task would used existing Open Source tools and standards. For Swarm framework would developed ontology layer that provide support for use external ontology for modeling, interaction between application and runtime bidirectional influence between application and ontology.

This included:
  * Java library (integrated into Java Swarm) that provide access to model based on ontology.
  * Implement support RDF(S) or OWL ontology format.
  * Demo application (or updated existing one) and tutorial about use ontology for ABM with Swarm.
  * Basic infrastructure for further dynamic ontology research.
