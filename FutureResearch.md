  1. Java model building
    * Replace custom code generation code in OwlModelBuilder
    * Experiment with cglib about dynamic code generation. This feature maybe useful in dynamic ontology update
  1. JENA library for ontology runtime manipulation
    * Use Jena to represent swarm world as ontology space with instances
    * Use Jena to persist and load ontology space
    * Use Jena to query ontology space - maybe space update
